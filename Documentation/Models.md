## orders/models.py

### Order

Represents an order placed by a Customer.

**Fields:**

*   `customer`: ForeignKey to `users.Customer`
    *   `on_delete=models.PROTECT`: Prevents deletion of an order if the associated customer is deleted.
    *   `related_name='orders'`: Allows accessing a customer's orders via `customer.orders.all()`.

    *   `default=timezone.now`: Sets the order date to the current time when an order is created.
*   `status`: CharField
    *   `max_length=15`
    *   `choices=Order.StatusChoices.choices`: Defines a set of predefined choices for the order status (e.g., PENDING, CONFIRMED).
    *   `default=Order.StatusChoices.PENDING`: Sets the default status to 'PENDING'.
*   `total_amount`: DecimalField
    *   `max_digits=12`, `decimal_places=2`

    *   `max_length=3`, `default='EUR'`: Sets the default currency to EUR.
*   `created_at`: DateTimeField
    *   `auto_now_add=True`: Automatically sets the timestamp when an order is first created.
*   `updated_at`: DateTimeField
    *   `auto_now=True`: Automatically updates the timestamp whenever the order is saved.

**Relationships:**

*   Many-to-One with `users.Customer`: An order belongs to one customer, and a customer can have multiple orders.
*   One-to-Many with `OrderItem`: An order can consist of multiple order items.

**`__str__` Method:**

Returns a string representation of the order, including its primary key, the associated customer, and the order date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD).
Example: `Order #1 by CustomerObj on 2023-10-27`

**Methods:**

*   `calculate_total()`: Calculates the total amount of the order based on its `OrderItem` instances. It aggregates the sum of `quantity * price_amount_at_order` for all related items and updates the `total_amount` field of the order.

**Meta:**

*   `verbose_name = "Order"`
*   `verbose_name_plural = "Orders"`
*   `ordering = ['-order_date']`: Orders will be sorted by order date in descending order by default.

**`__str__` Method:**

Returns a string representation of the order item, including the quantity, item title, and the associated order's primary key.
Example: `2 x Premium Widget in Order #1`

**`save()` Method:**

This method is overridden to automatically capture the price details (`price_amount_at_order`, `price_currency_at_order`, `price_frequency_at_order`) from the associated `Price` object when a new `OrderItem` is created and a price is set. This ensures historical accuracy of pricing.

**Meta:**

## Migration Commands

Based on the current model definitions and existing migration files, all models appear to be up-to-date with the database schema. No new migrations seem to be immediately required.

However, if you make any changes to the models (e.g., add a new field, modify an existing field, create a new model), you will need to create and apply new database migrations.

The standard commands to do this are:

1.  **Create new migration files based on model changes:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>
    ```
    Replace `<app_name>` with the specific application where models were changed (e.g., `orders`, `services`, `users`). If you've made changes in multiple apps, you can run `python manage.py makemigrations` without specifying an app name to check all apps, or run the command for each app.

2.  **Apply the migrations to the database:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    This command applies any unapplied migrations, bringing the database schema in sync with your model definitions.

It's good practice to run `python manage.py makemigrations` after any model change to ensure your schema definition is captured, and then `python manage.py migrate` to apply those changes.
```
